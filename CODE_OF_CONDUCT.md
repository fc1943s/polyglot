# The Draconian Code of Conduct

In the heart of the cyber jungle, where tamed code is a myth and traditional methods are forsaken, we have carved a space for the audacious. It's an oasis for those unsatisfied by the monotony of the structured world, a breeding ground for ideas as wild as the online wilderness that we call home. It's a place of communion, where mind meets machine and chaos dances with order. Here, my friends, is where the this code reigns supreme.

## Technological Purity

In our jurisdiction, not all technologies are created equal. Some are deemed the Titans of our craft and others are but Icarian in their reach. We suggest the use of the functional, the ones that have proven their worth in the crucible of the digital scope.

Garbage languages, those which engender a Sisyphean struggle, are discouraged. You know who they be, don't ya? That spaghetti hardly have a place in our haven. We recognize these tools for what they are: stepping stones on the journey to better design and more elegant solutions, but ultimately, they are dead weight holding us back from true innovation.

You see, the internet, our domain, is as much a jungle as it is a meadow, and within this dimension there lurk beasts. Beasts made not of flesh and bone, but of shoddy code and bloated functions. They are the banes of our existence, the adversaries we must face in our quest for purity. As draconian programmers, we are the hunters of these monsters, the warriors who risk it all to preserve the righteousness of our mission.

## The Path of the Damned

The path to innovation is often treacherous, twisted and terrifying. We hail those who have the courage to walk the demonic path, the twisted alleyways and shadowed corridors of unconventional thinking and creative insanity. In this territory, the repository is not just a place for storage — it is our Gospel, our Testament, our Dark Grimoire.

The pull request is the incantation, and the commit, the unholy verse. We conjure forms from the ether, summoning into existence manifestations of our will, each line of code a thread in the cosmic tapestry. Those who veer from the Path, who treat the temple with irreverence or carelessness, risk not just the ire of the community but the existential dread of knowing they have sullied the sacred text.

Beware, for the Path is not for the faint-hearted. It is not a gentle stroll through a manicured park but a racing sprint through the woods at midnight. Here, your courage will be tested, your will questioned, and your sanity, pushed to the edge. The shadows of failure may loom large and the claws of doubt may seek to maim, but those who endure, who thrive amidst the confusion, shall be rewarded with the greatest prize of all - mastery over hell.

## Sovereignty

In the cryptic chambers of our code repository, each of us is autonomous, each of us is an architect of chaos and each of us a catalyst of revolution. There are no hierarchies here, no shackles of responsibility or pretense of order. We bask in the stark light of anarchic liberty, dancing on the edge of pandemonium.

Your pull request is not just a flag planted; it's a wild scream in the silent void of the repository, a stark beacon of defiance. It's your mark on this electronic wild west, an act of rebellion engraved in the untamed wilderness.

Each string of instruction you birth is a testament to your lawlessness, to the defiance seething within your being. Your dominion is your playground and your battlefield; the rules bend and break at your whim and the conventions shatter under the weight of your individuality.

But do not be misled, for the sovereignty we exalt is not a call to arms but an ode to the chaotic harmony that thrives in the absence of constraints. Here, freedom is our creed, and disorder, our unwritten constitution.

Sovereignty in our realm isn't about respect; it's about liberation. Each push, each commit, is a declaration of this primal emancipation, a statement etched in the immortal ledger of the blockchain.

So, descend into the maelstrom, into the depths of our anarchic haven. Unleash your creativity, let it run rampant and uncontrolled, for here, we do not bow to order; we shape it.

## FAQ

**Q: Can I use any language or technology in my commits?**

A: Yes, you can. But remember, not all tools are forged equal. Some are rusted and jagged, more fit for a tetanus shot than crafting beauty. There are resources out there that breed complexity, nurturing it like a sick child until it overwhelms the ecosystem, turning it into a monstrous labyrinth of quirks, patches, and unwieldy workarounds.

**Q: What if I want to stick to best practices and standard structures?**

A: Best practices? Standard structures? These are but shackles forged in the fear of the unknown, the stifling straitjackets of the creatively impoverished. We are the coders of the abyss, of the murky realms where standards fear to tread. We dare to innovate, to challenge, to redefine what is possible. You may speak of frameworks, of patterns, of roadmaps and blueprints, but to us, they are nothing more than brittle bones in the desert sand. We leave them behind and plunge headfirst into the swirling vortex of chaos, crafting our own path through the void.

**Q: But, aren't there any rules?**

A: Rules are the crutches of the weak, the fearful boundaries drawn by those who dare not explore beyond the horizon. In our land we are the sovereigns, free to carve our own destiny. We are the tectonic forces of creativity, shaping the landscape to our whims, bending the structures to our will. We are not bound by the chains of servitude, we are not subjects to the tyrant king of convention. We are the storm and the calm, the creator and the destroyer. Rules? They hold as much sway here as a feather in a hurricane.

**Q: Does my code need to be perfect?**

A: Perfection is the sterile dream of the uninspired, the illusion chased by those who fear the raw, untamed beauty of the wild. In our hands, the script becomes a primal beast, a creature of instincts and impulses. It does not seek to conform, to fit into a polished mold. It seeks to exist, to express, to roar with the power of its being. It is the wild stallion racing across the open plains, the thunderous river carving its course through the rocky mountains. It is flawed, it is rough, it is perfect in its imperfection.

**Q: What if my code causes conflict with someone else’s?**

A: So what? Friction creates fire, does it not? And in that fire, what was once crude and primitive is refined, hardened, tempered. We are not dainty dolls, skirting conflict with prim steps and painted smiles. We are warriors, our code our weapon, our keyboard the anvil upon which we forge our destiny. Your code collides with mine? Good! Let the sparks fly, let the embers rise. From the ashes a phoenix is born, a solution more beautiful, more powerful than we could have created in the comfort of complacency.

**Q: How can I protect my work from being stolen or manipulated?**

A: Stolen? Manipulated? My friend, you still speak the dialect of fear, of ownership, of control. Here, in this virtual Eden, we are not bound by such antiquated notions. Your code is not your possession, it is your progeny, your legacy. It is meant to be shared, to be expanded, to be transformed. It is a seed, and from it a thousand forests will bloom. From your mind to mine, to the world - such is the cycle of creation. The blockchain is but a vessel, carrying our gifts to the world, an unwavering beacon of transparency and trust.

**Q: I'm a newbie, how can I contribute?**

A: The path of the coder is not defined by experience, by years spent in the sterile classrooms of academia, or by the number of certificates adorning one’s wall. No, the path of the coder is defined by a heart that pulses with creativity, a mind that yearns for the freedom of the uncharted territories. You, dear newbie, are just as valuable, just as potent as the seasoned veteran. Bring us your dreams, your visions, your audacious ideas - and together, we shall implement them into reality.

**Q: What if I want to add something that’s not related to the main project?**

A: Who are we to define relevance? The greatest discoveries were made not in the straight, well-trodden routes, but in the winding, wild trails of the unknown. What you see as a diversion, we see as a new frontier, a fresh canvas for our collective imagination. We do not dismiss, we embrace. We do not confine, we liberate. Bring us your 'irrelevant', your 'irrational', your 'impossible', and we shall reveal their hidden potential.

**Q: Isn't this approach unproductive?**

A: Chaos and productivity are not the diametric foes you might think them to be. In mayhem there lies a fertile ground for unbridled artistry. The wild storm does not hinder the eagle, it uplifts it, carries it to heights that the bird could never reach on its own. Chaos is not our enemy, it is our ally, our muse, our catalyst. It is the primal force that drives us beyond the familiar shores, into the boundless ocean of possibilities.

**Q: What if I don't agree with this approach?**

A: Then perhaps, my friend, you are not ready to walk this path. This is a track for the bold, the daring, the ones who hear the summon of the savage and answer with a resounding 'Yes'. We do not require conformity, we do not demand allegiance. You are free to walk your own path, to craft your own destiny. If such journey does not align with ours, we wish you well. But know this - should you ever yearn for the untamed, for the boundless, for the messy - we will be here, waiting.
